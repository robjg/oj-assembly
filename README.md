# oj-assembly

The Oddjob application build configuration that is used to create the binary and source 
distributions found on Sourceforge.

Additionally, the `pom.xml` here provides a Maven multi-module build for Oddjob which is used 
for the daily development of Oddjob. 

The full application build uses a combination of Maven and Ant. It is run from oddjob
using this [oddjob.xml](oddjob.xml) root configuration, however the 
[assemble-oddjob.xml](assemble-oddjob.xml) file does most of the work, including defining
which modules are included in the application. The modules are expected
to exist in sibling directories in the file system. 

The `clean` and `install` phases of the build are passed through to 
an `oj-assemble.xml` Oddjob configuration
in each module that can chose how to build for their module, such as running Maven.

The source and binary distributions are still built with Ant and a build.xml file
must exist in each module with a `dist-bin` and a `dist-src` target.

The API doc and reference are built using separate configurations 
[assemble-javadoc.xml](assemble-javadoc.xml) and [assemble-reference.xml](assemble-reference.xml)
which must be modified to add new modules.

To build the Markdown references that are on GitHub are generated by 
manually running 
```
mvn javadoc:javadoc@reference 
```
In each module. Oddjob has its own definition that replaces the
parent default which creates the reference for both Oddjob 
and Arooa.
